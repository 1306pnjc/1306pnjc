# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **@1306pnjc**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My journey into tech started as a childhood dream, where I set out to tick off a few goals like building websites. While web development was a great way to do that, my main passion now lies in **enhancing my problem-solving skills** and **exploring the depths of computer science**. Iâ€™m currently in my **5th semester** of **Computer Science** at the **University of Botswana**, where Iâ€™m learning new techniques, solving complex problems, and keeping an open mind about where this journey will take me.

## ðŸŒ± **What Iâ€™m focusing on:**
- Problem-solving skills and algorithms
- Exploring different programming languages and paradigms
- Enhancing my understanding of computer science fundamentals

## ðŸš€ **My Internship Experience:**
- **Intern at Prodigy** â€“ I had the opportunity to work on several web development projects, which helped me build real-world applications while collaborating with talented teams. Though my main focus is now broader, this experience helped me gain valuable skills in software development and team collaboration.

## ðŸ’» **Projects Iâ€™ve Worked On:**
1. **[Weather Website](https://github.com/1306pnjc/PRODIGY_WD_05)**: A simple web app that checks the weather by integrating with a public API.
2. **[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/1306pnjc/PRODIGY_WD_03)**: A classic game built using JavaScript, focused on problem-solving and implementing game logic.
3. **[Stopwatch](https://github.com/1306pnjc/PRODIGY_WD_02)**: A clean and functional stopwatch app to explore JavaScript and UI/UX design.

## ðŸ“« **How to Reach Me:**
- Email: [phazhachakalisa@gmail.com](mailto:phazhachakalisa@gmail.com)
  
Feel free to reach out for collaborations, feedback, or just to connect!

## ðŸ”§ **Technologies I work with:**
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Java (learning more languages as I go)
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code
- **Areas of Interest**: Algorithms, Digital Forensics, Software Engineering, Data Structures

## âš¡ **Fun Fact:**
I love solving complex problems and constantly challenge myself with new algorithms and coding puzzles. Although Iâ€™m still figuring out my specific path, Iâ€™m particularly interested in areas like **Digital Forensics** and **Algorithm Science**, but Iâ€™m always open to exploring new fields within computer science.

Letâ€™s collaborate, learn together, and solve problems! ðŸš€
